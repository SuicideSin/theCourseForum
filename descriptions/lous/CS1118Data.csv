What are the important criteria for a building envelope that is to meet environmental expectations and requirements in the Twenty-First-Century? 15-20% of a building's energy consumption might be attributed to building envelope - given this, small shifts in strategy have the potential to make a considerable 'sustainable' contribution!"

The concepts of time value and risk are used to value the two basic financial assets, bonds and stocks, as well as real assets, investment projects, and companies. In addition, the course introduces derivative securities (options, futures) and discusses their application in a wide variety of settings (real options, contingent claims valuation of equity). The course also covers the theory and practice of capital structure decisions (Modigliani and Miller, taxes, bankruptcy costs, asymmetric information, agency) and dividend decisions. The course will include a thorough discussion of market efficiency and an introduction to the field of behavioral finance. A unifying theme of the course is how no-arbitrage conditions and the law of one price can be used to value most financial assets.

The balancing of environmental and economic costs and benefits, coupled with human beliefs about what is 'right' or 'wrong,' is at the heart of the environmental decision-making process. The process is complex because it involves a diverse set of stakeholders with differing perspectives and objectives.

Entertainment services, encompassing motion pictures, television, broadcasting, publishing, music, sports, tourism, Internet, gaming, performing arts, and theme parks, are rapidly growing and taking a center stage in today's service-driven economy. As the leading U.S. export category, they generate $500 billion worldwide. Entertainment services share several unique features, such as highly uncertain demand, short lifecycles, experiential nature, and sequential distribution. These features require in-depth understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities in managing their new product introductions, pricing, media planning and promotion, and distribution. This course will merge real-world knowledge of how various entertainment services operate, conceptual framework of marketing strategies, and hands-on analytical tools that aid practical decision making.

Students also will learn how to distinguish between different types of mergers and to discern the appropriate tools required for integrating two or more separate organizations.

Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."
