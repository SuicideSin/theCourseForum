Special attention is given to understanding the nature of the crystalline state and wave-particle diffraction with a strong emphasis on the reciprocal lattice concept. Thermal properties are approached by discussing the Einstein and Debye solids and the concept of lattice waves and phonons. The elements of Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics are reviewed leading to the development of an electron theory of solids. The concepts of Fermi surface and Fermi energy, Brillouin zones, valence and conduction bands are discussed extensively. The atomic origin of magnetism and magnetic effects in solids are analyzed as well as magnetic hysteresis and technical magnetic properties.

Data mining in this context provides a formal basis for machine learning and knowledge discovery. This course investigates the construction of empirical models from data mining for systems with both discrete and continuous valued responses. It covers both estimation and classification, and explores both practical and theoretical aspects of data mining.  Prerequisite: SYS 6021, SYS 4021, or STAT 5120."
