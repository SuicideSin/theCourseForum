We will focus throughout the course on the sociocultural context of education, addressing values, ideology, practices and policies as they are found across a diverse selection of nations and societies.  What can we learn from comparisons?  What theories currently shape international educational developments?  By gaining knowledge about how other countries approach key issues in education, it is hoped that students can broaden their understanding of their own educational practices, beliefs, and policies, and work toward more effective educational practice in an increasingly global educational arena."

Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think deeply about the nature of business, the responsibilities of management, and how business and ethics can be put together. Cases without easy answers that raise a range of problems facing managers in the contemporary business environment will be used. Discussions will focus on developing a framework for analyzing the issues in moral terms and then making a decision and developing a set of reasons for why the decision was justified. Students will be pushed to think carefully about how they make decisions and develop their capacity to defend their decisions to other stakeholders. This is important as a way not only to foster integrity and responsible decision making, but also to push students to take leadership roles in dealing with complex and difficult choices they will face in their careers. Operating from a managerial perspective, students will address a range of themes in the class, including basic concepts in ethics, responsibilities to stakeholders and the building blocks of markets, corporate culture, the sources of ethical breakdowns in organizations, managerial integrity, value creation, and personal values and managerial choice."

Although students pursuing these career paths do not need tax expertise, they do need to be able to evaluate critically when to call in the tax experts and what the tax experts are telling them. Therefore this course provides a general understanding of the basic tax consequences of fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. The course requires students to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal to the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors to make better decisions and to be more effective negotiators. Although the course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies.

In the course, students will discover that the issues, challenges, and perspectives differ as much as the numbers in the financials as well as what happens after the start-up or acquisition of a firm. Typical issues addressed are finding a job with a smaller enterprise, the characteristics of the smaller enterprise, creating value as a smaller enterprise CEO, management transitions associated with stages of small business growth, challenges of finding, retaining, and losing employees, special issues and considerations in the family-owned business, franchising as a financing and growth mechanism, import-export operations and international dimensions of small business, ethical challenges of everyday life in the small firm, the balancing act of personal, family, and business realities of the smaller firm, and exiting a venture on your terms."

This knowledge adds value in two respects. First, it facilitates communication with lawyers and understanding the advice they provide. Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

Students will also, through the use of assignments and problem sets, develop an intuitive understanding of why these products are used and the fundamental relationships that underlay all derivative products."

The resolution of this tension creates a dilemma for investment professionals. Some may choose to blindly accept theory and ignore the real-world realities of the market place. Others may choose to casually dismiss financial theory as unrealistic and irrelevant. Because either of these responses is likely to be perilous, this course seeks to fill the need for a more balanced response. Students may begin the course understanding that traditional finance theory relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the behavior of buyers and sellers of financial securities and conditions of the market in which they trade. This course surveys areas of common departure from the traditional assumptions of investor behavior and market conditions with a view to evaluating their impact on investment decision rules."

These include: building and maintaining strategic alliances and networks; furthering team creativity and innovation; fostering collaborative organizational cultures and working relationships; containing financial and human costs; and, ultimately, improving business results. While rooted in negotiation and conflict theory, this course will provide pragmatic and practical general management skills and should therefore be of interest to all students, regardless of their specific career or personal goals. Bargaining and Negotiating is a prerequisite for this course. Principal modes of instruction are cases, readings, extended simulations, and in-class exercises."

It is aimed at attracting a group of interested students who believe they will be likely to have banking or consulting clients in the Life Sciences industry or who aspire to take a role in the creation of new enterprises in this sector. In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues. Course content will include cases, class discussions, background reading, guest lectures, and individual and student team projects.

Students also will participate in a comprehensive review of nine analytical models. Each model is designed to foster robust thinking about experiential innovation and will be accompanied by a handful of typical examples, followed by open discussion and an interactive exercise aimed at making application to specific businesses and industries.

It also demonstrates why innovation is increasingly important, not only to technology companies but also to companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Through business cases and filmed interviews, students will examine companies and leaders that have been successful at building cultures of innovation.

The latter problem is unique to the small, privately held business. In addition to considering typical issues of asset management, including acquisitions and dispositions, the course will cover topics such as working-capital management, selecting funding sources and structuring loans, project finance, creating liquidity, and transferring the business to the next generation or selling it.

The course emphasizes the tactical aspects of business marketing as well as conceptual and strategic elements of the marketing-planning process. The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses. As opportunities arise, the course will incorporate a 'live' case. Working with a company to address critical marketing problems, student teams will be assigned to work on these problems.

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

Values and ethics as essential elements of leadership are the central focus. The course will provide students with examples and models of ways in which leaders have incorporated ethics and values into many definitions of leadership. Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their own values and ethics as well as examine and build upon their own definition of leadership. Each session will be devoted to a different leader, focusing on their background, context, and type of leadership they displayed. Insights from these leaders and an array of readings on leadership will be used to foster reflection on what makes a great leader. The majority of leaders chosen for study, although familiar, are not business entrepreneurs or leaders of large corporations. The idea is to think more broadly about what makes great leadership by looking at a series of figures who offer a range of approaches to leadership and the value systems that can underlie it. Some leaders covered in past courses were Sir Ernest Shackleton, George Patton, Chairman Mao, Oscar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mustafa Ataturk, Al Groh, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Fudge, and Muhammad Yunus. Our focus will be on these leaders, their stories, and how they connect values and leadership, but at the end of each study students will connect the discussions back to the present and their challenges as future leaders."
